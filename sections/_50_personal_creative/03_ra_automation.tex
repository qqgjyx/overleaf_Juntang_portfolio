\subsection*{Resident Advisor Automation Suite}

\textbf{Context:} As a Resident Advisor (RA) at Duke Kunshan University (Aug 2024 - Present), I faced repetitive administrative tasks: scheduling duty rotations, tracking residence hall maintenance requests, creating door decorations for residents, and generating monthly reports. I automated these workflows using Python, serving residents across 3 years while handling 50+ incidents.

\textbf{Tools Developed:}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=4em, labelwidth=3.5em, labelsep=0.5em]
  \item[Duty Scheduler:] Constraint satisfaction algorithm that generates fair rotation schedules respecting RA preferences and conflicts
  \item[Door Decor Generator:] Python script to scrape Reddit images and resident roster for automatic door decoration creation, used by fellow RAs
  \item[Maintenance Tracker:] SQLite database with web interface (Flask) for logging and tracking maintenance requests with priority levels
  \item[Monthly Reports:] Auto-generated PDF reports with statistics, charts (matplotlib), and narrative summaries
\end{description}

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Technical Highlights:}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em, itemsep=0.1em]
  \item \textbf{Duty Scheduler:} Formulated as constraint satisfaction problem (CSP); used backtracking with forward checking to find valid schedules
  \item \textbf{Door Decorations:} Template system with Jinja2-style placeholders; batch generation from CSV of resident names
  \item \textbf{Maintenance Tracker:} RESTful API with authentication; automated email notifications when requests are resolved
  \item \textbf{Reports:} ReportLab for PDF generation; matplotlib for charts; Jinja2 for HTML templates
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em, itemsep=0.1em]
  \item Reduced time spent on scheduling from 2 hours/month to 5 minutes
  \item Door decor script was shared with and adopted by fellow RAs across Duke Kunshan University
  \item Maintenance tracking improved response time and organization efficiency
  \item Demonstrated practical application of programming skills to solve real-world administrative challenges
\end{itemize}
