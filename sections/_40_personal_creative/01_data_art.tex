\subsection*{Generative Data Art}

\textbf{Concept:} Exploring the boundary between scientific visualization and artistic expression by creating aesthetically compelling images from real datasets.

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Examples:}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em, itemsep=0.1em]
  \item \textbf{Neural Network Weights:} Visualized CNN filter weights as abstract patterns; used dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) to create 2D/3D compositions
  \item \textbf{Audio Waveforms:} Converted music into polar coordinate spectrograms with artistic color gradients; printed as posters
  \item \textbf{Fractal Generation:} Implemented Julia set and Mandelbrot set renderers with custom color palettes; explored connections to dynamical systems
  \item \textbf{Geographic Data:} Created minimalist maps from OpenStreetMap data with stylized rendering (inspired by Stamen Design)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Tools Used:} Python (NumPy, Pillow, matplotlib, seaborn), Processing (Java), D3.js for web-based interactive visualizations

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Philosophy:} Data visualization shouldn't just communicate informationâ€”it should evoke curiosity and aesthetic appreciation. By treating data as creative medium, we can engage broader audiences with scientific concepts.
